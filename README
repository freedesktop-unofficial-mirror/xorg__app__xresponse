xresponse
====

'xresponse' is a simple tool for meassuring UI response times to a
full mouse click event. It requires the Xtest, to 'fake' the mouse
event, and XDamage, to report areas of the display that have changed.


Building
====

Its recommended you have the freedesktop.org autotooled xlibs
installed with pkg-config (.pc ) files for xlibs, xext, xtst and
xdamage. Then it should be a case of the usual ./configure, make and
make install.
